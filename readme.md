# Noise reduction and accuracy improver of a Speech Recognition machine learning model.

## Summary/Objective (Machine Learning)
Noise reduction and accuracy improver of a Speech Recognition machine learning model. Modern software can reduce noise at a certain level. We will be trying to incorporate reduction of background noise including hums, chatter, and street noise to provide a good quality clear audio output with top most accuracy. We will also train the model with audio datasets to improve the efficiency of the model at real time speech recognition.  

 
**Challenge:** Accuracy is the main challenge that is being faced in this market of speech recognition. Even Google sometimes misinterprets what a person is actually saying. The accuracy also hinders due the background noise while a person is speaking. So to reduce the noise in order to have a crystal clear audio is what we will be trying to do in this project.

## Current Structure
1. Pre proccess data and perform feature extraction
2. Arrange features and labels into a vector
3. Use learning alogrithm to predict audio features for clean data, given noisy data
4. Using learned model, take in input and use predection to get clean audio vector
5. Reconstruct audio from that feature vector
